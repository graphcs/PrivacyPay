SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY

# Frontend Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID=YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Smart Contract Addresses (after deployment)
ETHEREUM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
SEPOLIA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
# API Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Redis (for production scaling)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

### Contract Requirements
- Privacy pool contract with:
  - Deposit functionality
  - Shield/unshield operations
  - Zero-knowledge proof verification
  - Nullifier tracking
  - Merkle tree management

### Deployment Steps
1. Compile and test contracts
2. Deploy to testnet first
3. Verify contract source code
4. Update environment variables
5. Test all integrations
6. Deploy to mainnet

## Circuit Setup for Production

### Trusted Setup Requirements
- Multi-party computation ceremony
- Transparent setup process
- Public verification of parameters
- Secure key distribution

### Setup Process
1. Generate powers of tau
2. Conduct ceremony with multiple participants
3. Generate proving and verification keys
4. Distribute keys securely
5. Update application configuration

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- API server health: `GET /health`
- Circuit compilation status
- Smart contract sync status
- Database connectivity
- External service availability

### Metrics to Monitor
- Transaction volume and success rates
- Proof generation times
- API response times
- Error rates and types
- System resource usage

### Alerting
- High error rates
- Service downtime
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Security events
- Performance degradation

## Security Considerations

### Development vs Production
- Development uses mock circuits and keys
- Production requires formal security audits
- Key management is critical in production
- Network security and monitoring required

### Ongoing Security
- Regular security assessments
- Dependency updates and scanning
- Incident response procedures
- User education and documentation

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor system health and performance
- Review and respond to security alerts
- Update dependencies and security patches
- Backup and recovery testing

### Incident Response
- 24/7 monitoring for critical issues
- Documented escalation procedures
- Communication plans for users
- Post-incident review and improvement
