# Compliance Guide

This guide explains the compliance features of the Privacy Payments MVP and how they can be used to meet regulatory requirements while maintaining user privacy.

## Overview

Privacy Payments implements a **selective disclosure** model that allows users to maintain transaction privacy by default, while providing mechanisms for regulatory compliance when required.

## Key Concepts

### View Keys vs Audit Keys

#### View Keys
- **Purpose**: Allow users to selectively disclose their transaction history
- **Scope**: Limited to transactions involving the specific account
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Tax reporting
  - Court orders
  - Voluntary compliance disclosure
  - Personal record keeping

#### Audit Keys  
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive access for regulatory oversight
- **Scope**: Can analyze transaction patterns and risk assessment
- **Use Cases**:
  - Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance
  - Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures
  - Financial intelligence unit investigations
  - Regulatory audits

### Privacy vs Transparency Spectrum

The system provides a spectrum of privacy and transparency options:

1. **Full Privacy**: Default state - transactions are completely private
2. **Selective Disclosure**: User-controlled transparency via view keys
3. **Regulatory Access**: Comprehensive oversight via audit keys
4. **Public Transactions**: Traditional blockchain transparency (for comparison)

## Regulatory Considerations
